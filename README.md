# Oodler
Makes text go oodle by replacing vowels with "oodle"

Oodler is a small website that I created which includes a textbox. When text is entered into the textbox, another field returns the same text but with "oodle" being in place instead of vowels.

This was one of my first projects that involved using JavaScript to handle text replacement and interacting with the web-based text-to-speech (TTS) functions. I also learned how to use the basics of [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create a modern looking user interface.

In addition to this, I added the Konami Code to the website as an Easter Egg feature, which reveals extra functionality.
